# Simulator-Polarization-State-EMW
This is a simulator to visualize the polarization states for different rotation and ellipticity angles. it is made for simulating freespace, metallic plate reflection, dielectric plate reflection and for a dielectric plate with incident angle equal to the brewster angle.

In order to work with the simulator, the program should be run using python 3.11 and the packages numpy, matplotlib, and Tkinter should be installed. Using the buttons in the interface, the simulator can change between multiple states/types and the angles can be updated using the sliders.

Have fun!!
