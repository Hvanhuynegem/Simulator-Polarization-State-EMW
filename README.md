# Simulator-Polarization-State-EMW
This is a simulator to visualize the polarization states for different rotation and ellipticity angles. it is made for simulating freespace, metallic plate reflection, dielectric plate reflection and for a dielectric plate with incident angle equal to the brewster angle.
